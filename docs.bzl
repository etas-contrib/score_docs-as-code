Easy streamlined way for S-CORE docs-as-code.
"""

# Multiple approaches are available to build the same documentation output:
#
# 1. **Esbonio via IDE support (`ide_support` target)**:
#    - Listed first as it offers the least flexibility in implementation.
#    - Designed for live previews and quick iterations when editing documentation.
#    - Integrates with IDEs like VS Code but requires the Esbonio extension.
#    - Requires a virtual environment with consistent dependencies (see 2).
#
# 2. **Directly running Sphinx in the virtual environment**:
#    - As mentioned above, a virtual environment is required for running esbonio.
#    - Therefore, the same environment can be used to run Sphinx directly.
#    - Option 1: Run Sphinx manually via `.venv_docs/bin/python -m sphinx docs _build --jobs auto`.
#    - Option 2: Use the `incremental` target, which simplifies this process.
#    - Usable in CI pipelines to validate the virtual environment used by Esbonio.
#    - Ideal for quickly generating documentation during development.
#
# 3. **Bazel-based build (`docs` target)**:
#    - Runs the documentation build in a Bazel sandbox, ensuring clean, isolated builds.
#    - Less convenient for frequent local edits but ensures build reproducibility.
#
# **Consistency**:
# When modifying Sphinx extensions or configuration, ensure all three methods
# (Esbonio, incremental, and Bazel) work as expected to avoid discrepancies.
#
# For user-facing documentation, refer to `/README.md`.

      srcs: Explicit documentation source files, including generated files.
        Use this for a source-less bundle whose documentation is produced by a
        build action. All files must share one parent directory so they can be
        mounted as one bundle entry.
      data: Files owned by this bundle that are not discovered as documentation
        sources. Use this for runtime/support files that belong at the bundle's
        eventual mount location. ``docs(data = [...])`` is the corresponding
        shorthand for supporting files in the project's root bundle. Both
        forms make their files available to a build; only bundle data travels
        with a mounted bundle.
      entry_doc: bundle-relative docname attached when this bundle is mounted.
        Defaults to `index`.
      bundles: nested bundles to compose, each a dict
        {
            "bundle": <docs_bundle label>,
            "mount_at": <where it shall me mounted>,
            "attach_to": <optional document to attach the bundle to; for a bundle root it defaults to the mount_at parent's index>

                    links. Implementation target source files and their dependencies
                    are collected recursively; filegroups expand to their files.
