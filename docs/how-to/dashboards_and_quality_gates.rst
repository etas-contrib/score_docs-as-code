Build Dashboards and Quality Gates
==================================

Use this guide in repositories that consume docs-as-code as a Bazel
dependency.

Goals:

1. Publish traceability dashboards from repository needs.
2. Export machine-readable metrics.
3. Enforce CI thresholds with ``traceability_gate``.

What You Get
------------

With the ``docs(...)`` macro and ``score_metamodel`` extension enabled, your
repository can:

- build an HTML dashboard from its own Sphinx needs,
- include external needs from other repositories when desired,
- export ``needs.json`` and ``metrics.json`` for machine-readable reporting,
- gate CI on traceability thresholds via ``traceability_gate``.

Typical Setup
-------------

For details, see :ref:`setup`.

Minimal Configuration Example
-----------------------------

In ``docs/conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   score_metamodel_requirement_types = "feat_req,comp_req,aou_req"
   score_metamodel_include_external_needs = False

By default, ``score_metamodel`` autodiscovers requirement types from the
repository needs that are present in the current build. If
``score_metamodel_requirement_types`` is set, that explicit list overrides
autodiscovery.

Use ``score_metamodel_include_external_needs = True`` only in repositories that
intentionally aggregate requirements across module dependencies, such as
integration repositories. Use ``False`` for module repositories to gate only on
local traceability.

Building the Dashboard
----------------------

After building/running any docs command (i.e. ``bazel build //:needs_json`` or ``bazel run //:docs_check`` are the fastest):

The documentation build writes ``metrics.json`` via ``score_metamodel``, and the ``needs_json`` artifact contains:

- ``bazel-bin/needs_json/_build/needs/needs.json``
- ``bazel-bin/needs_json/_build/needs/metrics.json``

The dashboard charts and the CI gate both use the same computed metrics.

Inputs for Linkage Metrics
--------------------------

To get meaningful dashboard and gate values, consumer repositories typically
need three inputs:

1. Requirement and architecture needs in the documentation itself.
2. Source code references via :doc:`source_to_doc_links`.
3. Test metadata via :doc:`test_to_doc_links`.

If one of those inputs is missing, the related chart or gate metric will remain
empty or low.

Choosing Local vs Aggregated Views
----------------------------------

There are two common modes:

**Module repository**

- Set ``score_metamodel_include_external_needs = False``.
- Gate only on the needs owned by the repository itself.
- Use this for per-module implementation progress and traceability.

**Integration repository**

- Set ``score_metamodel_include_external_needs = True``.
- Aggregate requirements across module dependencies when that is the intended
  repository purpose.
- Use this for system or integration-level dashboards.

CI Quality Gate
---------------

Any docs build (``bazel run //:docs``, ``bazel run //:docs_check``, etc.)
writes ``metrics.json`` alongside the build output. Run the gate on the
exported metrics:

.. code-block:: bash

   bazel run //:docs && \
   bazel run //:traceability_gate -- \
      --metrics-json bazel-bin/needs_json/_build/needs/metrics.json \
      --min-req-code 70 \
      --min-req-test 70 \
      --min-req-fully-linked 60 \
      --min-tests-linked 70

In CI, wire targets through Bazel dependencies so test execution and
docs generation happen before the gate target.

In larger repositories, define a dedicated wrapper target for your standard
gate thresholds so CI calls a single Bazel target.

Useful flags:

- ``--require-all-links`` for strict 100 percent gating

Recommended Rollout
-------------------

For a new consumer repository:

1. Start with local-only metrics.
2. Enable ``scan_code`` and verify ``source_code_link`` coverage first.
3. Add test metadata and verify ``testlink`` coverage.
4. Introduce modest thresholds in CI.
5. Raise thresholds over time as the repository matures.
