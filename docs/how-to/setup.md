# Setup


## Overview

docs-as-code allows you to easily integrate Sphinx documentation generation into your
Bazel build system. It provides a collection of utilities and extensions specifically
designed to enhance documentation capabilities in S-CORE.

## Features

- Seamless integration with Bazel build system
- S-CORE process compliance
- Support for PlantUML diagrams
- Source code linking capabilities
- S-CORE layouts and themes

## Installation

### 1. MODULE.bazel file

Add the module to your `MODULE.bazel` file:

```starlark
bazel_dep(name = "score_docs_as_code", version = "4.1.0")
```

And make sure to also add the S-core Bazel registry to your `.bazelrc` file

```starlark
common --registry=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-score/bazel_registry/main/
common --registry=https://bcr.bazel.build
```

### 2. .bazelrc file

Since we use `PlantUML <https://www.plantuml.com>`_ for diagrams, we need some Java.
If there is no Java on your system, Bazel can download a remote JDK for you
but that requires some configuration in your `.bazelrc` file:

```
build --java_language_version=17
build --java_runtime_version=remotejdk_17
build --tool_java_language_version=17
build --tool_java_runtime_version=remotejdk_17
```

### 3. BUILD file


```starlark
load("@score_docs_as_code//:docs.bzl", "docs")

docs(
    source_dir = "<your sphinx source dir>",
    project = "<your project name>",
    project_url = "https://github.com/eclipse-score/<your-project>",
    data = [
        "@other_repo:needs_json",  # Optional, if you have dependencies
    ],
)
```

For configuration options see {ref}`docs_bazel-macros`.

### 4. Optional: add conf.py

No `conf.py` is required for the default setup. The `docs()` macro generates
one from `project` and `project_url`; the Docs-as-Code version and baseline
extensions are supplied automatically.

Add a `conf.py` to your source directory only when you need additional Sphinx
configuration. When it exists, it remains the authoritative configuration.

A custom `conf.py` applies to this repository's documentation targets. Its
effect on integrated documentation depends on the integration path: it affects
the exported `:needs_json`, but is not transferred when documentation sources
are mounted as a bundle, where the host configuration applies. Keep custom
configuration minimal.

#### 5. Run a documentation build:


```bash
bazel run //:docs
```

#### 6. Access your documentation at

`/_build/index.html`

## Next Step

After basic setup, see {doc}`dashboards_and_quality_gates` to configure
traceability dashboards, export `metrics.json`, and enforce CI quality gates in
consumer repositories.
