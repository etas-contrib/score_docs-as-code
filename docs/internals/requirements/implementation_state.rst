Tooling Coverage
================

This page shows how the docs-as-code tooling covers process and tool
requirements. It focuses on tooling capabilities offered to downstream
repositories rather than on product-specific traceability inside those
repositories.

Overview
--------

.. needpie:: Tool Requirements Status
   :labels: not implemented, implemented but incomplete traceability, fully linked
   :colors: red,yellow, green
   :filter-func: src.extensions.score_metrics.traceability_dashboard.pie_requirements_status(tool_req)

Jump to evidence tables:

- :ref:`Tool Requirement Implementation and Links table <tooling_coverage_table_impl_links>`
- :ref:`Process Requirement to Tool Requirement mapping table <tooling_coverage_table_process_mapping>`

How To Read These Levels
------------------------

The overview pie combines implementation state and traceability evidence:

- ``not implemented``:
   requirement has ``implemented == NO``.
- ``implemented but incomplete traceability``:
   requirement has ``implemented == YES`` or ``implemented == PARTIAL``,
   but is missing at least one traceability link (code link and/or test link).
- ``fully linked``:
   requirement is implemented and has both ``source_code_link`` and ``testlink``.

Implementation labels used on this page:

- ``NO``: requirement is not implemented.
- ``PARTIAL``: requirement is partly implemented.
- ``YES``: requirement is implemented.

Why multiple pies are shown:

- ``Requirements with Codelinks`` shows requirement-to-implementation traceability.
- ``Requirements with linked tests`` shows requirement-to-verification traceability.
- ``Requirements fully linked`` is the strict roll-up (both links present).

These are intentionally separate because they answer different diagnostics:
missing code links, missing test links, or both.
