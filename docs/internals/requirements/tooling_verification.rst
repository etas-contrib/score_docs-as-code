Tooling Verification
====================

This page describes verification evidence for the docs-as-code tooling itself.
It is intentionally separate from tooling coverage so downstream quality signals
such as unit tests, future static analysis, and other verification evidence can
evolve independently from traceability support.

Overview
--------

.. needpie:: Test Results
   :labels: passed, failed, skipped
   :colors: green, red, orange

   type == 'testcase' and result == 'passed'
   type == 'testcase' and result == 'failed'
   type == 'testcase' and result == 'skipped'

.. grid:: 2
   :class-container: score-grid

   .. grid-item-card::

      Failed Tests

      *Hint: this table is empty by definition, as PRs with failing tests are not allowed to be merged in docs-as-code repo.*

      No failing tests are expected in the current dataset.

   .. grid-item-card::

      Skipped / Disabled Tests

      *Hint: this table is empty by definition, as we do not allow skipped or disabled tests in docs-as-code repo.*

      No skipped or disabled tests are expected in the current dataset.


Testcase Metadata Overview
--------------------------

*Data is not filled out yet within the test cases.*

.. needpie:: Test Types Used In Testcases
   :labels: fault-injection, interface-test, requirements-based, resource-usage
   :legend:

   type == 'testcase' and test_type == 'fault-injection'
   type == 'testcase' and test_type == 'interface-test'
   type == 'testcase' and test_type == 'requirements-based'
   type == 'testcase' and test_type == 'resource-usage'


.. needpie:: Derivation Techniques Used In Testcases
   :labels: requirements-analysis, design-analysis, boundary-values, equivalence-classes, fuzz-testing, error-guessing, explorative-testing
   :legend:

   type == 'testcase' and derivation_technique == 'requirements-analysis'
   type == 'testcase' and derivation_technique == 'design-analysis'
   type == 'testcase' and derivation_technique == 'boundary-values'

All passed Tests
----------------

.. needtable:: SUCCESSFUL TESTS - status and link
   :filter: result == "passed"
   :tags: TEST
   :columns: name as "testcase";result;id as "link"

.. needtable:: SUCCESSFUL TESTS - verification mapping
   :filter: result == "passed"
   :tags: TEST
   :columns: name as "testcase";fully_verifies;partially_verifies

.. needtable:: SUCCESSFUL TESTS - optional metadata
