Testing
=======

docs-as-code verifies itself on several layers.
The following sections describe each testing method,
what it is used for,
and how to run it.

Development checks (pre-commit)
-------------------------------

To be executed before ``git-commit``.

.. code-block:: bash

   uvx pre-commit run --all-files

The hooks cover:

- Generic file hygiene:
  YAML/TOML/JSON validity, trailing whitespace, end-of-file newlines,
  merge-conflict markers, case conflicts, and private keys.
- Python style and linting with Ruff (fix in place).
- Python type checking with BasedPyright.
- GitHub Actions workflow linting with actionlint.
- Bazel module hygiene, including ``bazel mod tidy`` and a lockfile consistency check.
- Eclipse copyright header presence.


Python unit tests (score_pytest)
--------------------------------

The unit tests exercise individual Python functions and extensions
in isolation, without a Sphinx build.

They are defined with the custom ``score_pytest`` Bazel rule,
which wraps pytest and pins a single pytest version for the whole repository.

.. code-block:: bash

   bazel test --lockfile_mode=error //... --build_tests_only

Use this layer for logic inside the extensions,
the helper library,
and the command-line tools.

File-based RST rule checks (metamodel)
--------------------------------------

The file-based tests verify the Sphinx build rules and metamodel checks
including our whole S-CORE-specific Sphinx setup with extensions.
Each RST file under ``src/extensions/score_metamodel/tests/rst/`` is a small,
self-contained Sphinx document.
A SphinxTestApp builds it and the framework asserts on the resulting warnings,
using the ``:expect:`` / ``:expect_not:`` options on the needs.

You need one target per check category:

.. code-block:: bash

   bazel test //src/extensions/score_metamodel:file_based_tests_<category>

The categories are ``architecture``, ``attributes``, ``graph``,
``id_contains_feature``, ``options``, ``safety``, and ``security``.

Use this layer whenever you change the metamodel (``metamodel.yaml``)
or one of its checks.
How to write such a test file is described in
:doc:`extensions/rst_filebased_testing`.

End-to-end docs.bzl tests (docs_bzl)
------------------------------------

The end-to-end tests exercise the public ``docs()`` and ``docs_bundle()``
macros through real Bazel builds and ``bazel run`` invocations,
exactly like a consumer would use them.
They live under ``src/tests/docs_bzl`` and cover composition,
invalid configurations, external Bzlmod bundles,
and golden HTML/JSON output comparison.

They are not Bazel test targets,
but plain pytest tests that issue Bazel underneath
because these tests also verify our Bazel/Starlark code.

.. code-block:: bash

   .venv_docs/bin/python -m pytest -vv src/tests/docs_bzl

The suite must be run sequentially.
CI splits it with custom markers:
``bazel_cached`` (build-only, fast) and ``bazel_slow``
(Sphinx runs and expected-failure tests).

Use this layer for changes to the Bazel macros,
the bundle composition,
or the generated output format.
It is the "docs-bzl scope" in the diagram above.

Downstream compatibility tests
------------------------------

The downstream compatibility tests check that changes to docs-as-code
do not break real consumer repositories.
They build selected consumers both from a local checkout and from a Git remote,
using the changed docs-as-code as a dependency.

They live under ``src/tests/downstream_compatibility``:

.. code-block:: bash

   .venv_docs/bin/python -m pytest -s src/tests/downstream_compatibility

You can restrict the run to selected consumers
with a pytest ``-k`` expression,
for example ``-k "score"`` or ``-k "baselibs and remote"``.
In CI they run automatically.


Which test for what
-------------------

Use the first suitable one in the table below.
The later tests are slower.
