This file contains docs-as-code requirements which derived from upstream process requirements.
Those are specified in `bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/external/score_process_description+/needs_json/_build/needs/needs.json`

The docs-as-code requirements are implemented in this repository, most notably in `src/extensions/score_metamodel/metamodel.yaml`
The metamodel has references to docs-as-code requirement ids.

Ensure all of that is consistent.
