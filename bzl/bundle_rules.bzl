"""Internal Bazel support for composing reusable documentation bundles."""

# `docs_bundle` and `sphinx_docs_library` operate at a similar architectural level:
# both describe reusable, transitively composable collections of documentation sources
# that are later assembled into a Sphinx source tree.

# However, their data models and responsibilities differ significantly.

# `sphinx_docs_library` primarily models file placement. Each library contributes files
# together with a `strip_prefix` and a `prefix`, allowing the final Sphinx rule to map
# every source file to a new location in the generated source tree.

# `docs_bundle` instead models documentation structure at the bundle level. In
# addition to the source files, it propagates information such as:

# * where a bundle is mounted, * which document it is attached to, * which document acts
# as its entry point, * which repository owns its sources, * whether it is an internal
# or external bundle, * and how nested
# bundles are rebased when composed.

# It also performs bundle-specific validation and conflict detection. The propagated unit
# is therefore not just a set of files with path transformations, but a structured
# documentation component with composition semantics.

# Using `sphinx_docs_library` directly would not preserve the metadata required by this
# model. We would need a second provider alongside it and would still have to implement
# most of the bundle traversal, rebasing, validation, and composition logic ourselves.

# Extending `sphinx_docs_library` is also not a good fit. Its provider represents
# individual file mappings, while our provider represents complete mounted bundles. Adding
# the required metadata would therefore not be a small extension of the existing
# abstraction; it would change its propagated unit and its semantics. It would also couple
# SCORE-specific composition rules to the generic `rules_sphinxdocs` implementation.

# We therefore reimplement the relatively small overlapping part—transitive source
# collection—while keeping the richer bundle model explicit and independent.

# The name `docs_bundle` reflects that relationship: it fills the same general role
# as `sphinx_docs_library`, but uses a SCORE-specific data model for composing structured
# documentation bundles.
