"""Private Bazel action for building the Needs output in place.

The SCORE mount extension exposes bundle inputs directly from the Bazel
execution root. This action therefore provides Sphinx with the project's
primary source directory and the mount manifest. Bundle targets remain
explicit action inputs; a manifest by itself does not make the files named by
that manifest available inside a sandbox.
