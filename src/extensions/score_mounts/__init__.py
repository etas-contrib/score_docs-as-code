Bridge extension: consume the mounts manifest authored by Bazel rules and feed it to
``sphinx_mounts``.

All mount paths originate from Bazel; this extension performs no path computation. It:

* sets ``config.mounts`` so ``sphinx_mounts`` can build the documentation;
``score_sync_toml`` reads the resulting ``config.mounts`` directly to write the
generated ``ubproject.toml``.
